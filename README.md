# Intro-to-Java-Programming

I have successfully completed this object-oriented programming course taught in Java, by [Prof. Cay Horstmann](http://www.horstmann.com/)] on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). Several fundamental data structures and object-oriented design concepts (e.g., encapsulation, polymorphism) are practiced through the course. For the final project, I have created a game-playing agent to play [Connect Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).

#### Final Project:

[Connect 4 Game Project](https://github.com/vjauckus/Intro-to-Java-Programming/tree/master/FinalProject)

[My Agent (Inplemented my own game-play logic)](https://github.com/vjauckus/Intro-to-Java-Programming/blob/master/FinalProject/MyAgent.java)
