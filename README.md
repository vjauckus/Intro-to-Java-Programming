# Intro-to-Java-Programming

I have completed this object-oriented programming course taught in Java, by Prof. Cay Horstmann on Udacity. Several fundamental data structures and object-oriented design concepts (e.g., encapsulation, polymorphism) are practiced through the course. For the final project, I have created a game-playing agent to play Connect Four.
